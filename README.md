### University Project
Group coursework submission for the class *Internet Technology*, undertaken as part of my masters degree *MSc Software Development* from [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/softwaredevelopment/) in Mar 2017.

The task was to create a web app using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and deploy it using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

Our team built a productivity app called **memoryBank**, a to-do list application built around the premise that many tasks are re-occurring, and should be easily accessible to re-creation after their initial creation.

This project got an ⭐️**A1**⭐️ grade, and the feedback *'Best project this year!'*.

### Technologies
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Javascript
* Ajax
* Bootstrap
* HTML / CSS

Many of these technologies were new to us, and hence this project allowed us to become familiar with the various frameworks and new languages.
